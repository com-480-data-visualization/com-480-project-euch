			<p> <h2> Prototype of the website we will use for our Project for the CS-480 class.</h2><br/>
				The instructions of the project can be found <a href="https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/2020-project-guidelines/#latepolicy">here</a> and the github repository of our project can be found <a href="https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-euch">here</a>

				<h3>Our problematic is the following:</h3><br/>
				We choose the dataset “120 years of Olympic history athletes and results” because of our overall interest in sport and more particularly in the Olympic games which are arguably the biggest and most entertaining sports competitions. Moreover, we wanted to create some visualizations about an international topic and that could interest anyone. Finally, considering the actual situation with the Covid-19 crisis, we did not want to make a visualization using a dataset that is related to something negative such as disasters or pandemics.
				We will make two main visualizations following two different axes:
				<ul>
				<li> The first axis (VISUALIZATION 2) is a comparison of medals and participation of athletes in the past Olympic games. The goal of this visualization is to obtain a clear overview of the performances of a country, a region or a continent. Those performances can be compared with another country, region or continent at a specific Olympic game or over a given span of time. It will be aimed for the general public, at people that are not necessarily interested in sports but at least curious, for example, about a nation or a particular period of time.</li>
				<li> The second visualization (VISUALIZATION 1) is focused on the physical characteristics of athletes depending on the sport they are playing. The characteristics we are comparing are morphological ones such as height and weight as well as the sex and age. It will allow, for example, to see the morphology of medal-winning athletes over the years for a given sport. One could also observe the average characteristics of participating athletes of a particular country or region. This visualization is aimed at people that are more deeply interested in sport and are curious about the physical characteristics of athletes for different sports over the years. It is more oriented in a scientific way and will contain some specific data about the athletes that is not necessarily interesting for the general public.</li>
				</ul>
